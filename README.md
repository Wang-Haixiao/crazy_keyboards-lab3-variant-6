## Design notes

- By implementing lambda calculus, we learn a set of formal systems
  developed from mathematical logic, with rules for variable binding
  and substitution, to study how functions are abstractly defined,
  how functions are applied, and recursively. Lambda calculus, by comparison,
  is the most fundamental programming language, consisting of a
  transformation rule (substitution of variables) and a way
  to define functions abstractly.
